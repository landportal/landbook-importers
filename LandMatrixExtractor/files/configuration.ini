description_en = The Land Matrix is a global and independent land monitoring initiative. Our goal is to facilitate an open development community of citizens, researchers, policy-makers and technology specialists to promote transparency and accountability in decisions over land and investment. The data should not be taken as a reliable representation of reality. Reality is fast-changing as deals are changed, annulled or new ones spring up. Many deals are not yet included in the database. As an open tool, the Observatory allows wide participation in constantly upgrading, correcting and improving the information it contains. Over time, with your help, it will become more accurate. In addition to the Global Observatory, the Land Matrix Initiative supports, and is linked to, other more specific Observatories on land deals that are country, regional and thematic-based. The Land Matrix aims to contribute in an innovative and relevant way to the growing movement towards open development - allowing for greater public involvement in critical decisions that affect the lives of land-users around the world

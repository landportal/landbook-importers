desc_en = The Domestic Food Price Level Index is calculated by dividing the  Food Purchasing Power Parity (FPPP) by the General PPP, thus proiding an index of the price of food in the country relative to the price of the generic cosnumption basket. Data are available for 2005 from the ICP Program . It is then extended to other years by adjusting both numerator and denominator using the relative chenges in Food CPI and General CPI as provided by ILO.

desc_en = Access to an improved water source refers to the percentage of the population with reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved source, such as a household connection, public standpipe, borehole, protected well or spring, and rainwater collection. Unimproved sources include vendors, tanker trucks, and unprotected wells and springs. Reasonable access is defined as the availability of at least 20 liters a person a day from a source within one kilometer of the dwelling.

Improved facilities range from simple but protected pit latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facilities must be correctly constructed and properly maintained.

name_es = Desconocido

desc_en = The Prevalence of Undernourishment expresses the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population consumes an amount of calories that is insufficient to cover her/his energy requirement for an active and healthy life. The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily Dietary Energy Consumption with a threshold level called the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population. This is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator for Goal 1, Target 1.9. More details on the methodology for computing the Prevalence of undernourishment are in Annex 2 of the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013 Report

name_es = Desconocido
name_fr = Inconnu
desc_en = The depth of the food deficit indicates how many calories would be needed to lift the undernourished from their status, everything else being constant. The average intensity of food deprivation of the undernourished, estimated as the difference between the average dietary energy requirement and the average dietary energy consumption of the undernourished population (food-deprived), is multiplied by the number of undernourished to provide an estimate of the total food deficit in the country, which is then normalized by the total population

[ORGANIZATION]
name = FAO: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
description = FAO develops methods and standards for food and agriculture statistics, provides technical assistance services and disseminates data for global monitoring. Statistical activities at FAO include the development and implementation of methodologies and standards for data collection, validation, processing and analysis. FAO also plays a vital part in the global compilation, processing and dissemination of food and agriculture statistics, and provides essential statistical capacity development to member countries.
